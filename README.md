How the Program Works:
Encryption:

Each letter in the input message is shifted by a specified value.
The shift wraps around within the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'z' by 1 results in 'a').
Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.
Decryption:

The same process as encryption, but the shift is reversed.
User Input:

The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message.
The user enters the message and the desired shift value.
Main Function:

This function handles the user interface and directs the program based on user input.
Example Usage:
Encryption:

Input: "Hello, World!" with shift 3
Output: "Khoor, Zruog!"
Decryption:

Input: "Khoor, Zruog!" with shift 3
Output: "Hello, World!"
This program provides a simple and interactive way to use the Caesar Cipher for encryption and decryption.
